# atom-dark-roast
A theme I created that has very nice colours IMHO. It was initially based on the "coffee dark roast" theme from sublime and was ported to Atom. Then I ported it to VSCode and has changed a lot since resembling "coffee dark roast". I just want to give credit where due since the original theme was one of my favourites.

This is **not** supposed to be a released syntax theme.
